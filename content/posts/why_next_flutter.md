Mobile development has changed a lot in the last few years. In the past, if you wanted to build a fast, smooth app, you had to build native apps for both iOS and Android. Cross-platform apps were mostly web-based, slow, and unpolished.

But now, things are different. Cross-platform solutions like Flutter can meet the needs of most products. In fact, it's often better to start with Flutter and only move to native development if your product demands it.

Here are a few reasons why your next app should be in Flutter. 

### Increased productivity

Flutter allows developers to write one codebase that can be used to build apps for both Android and iOS. This can save a lot of time and effort, as developers don't have to write separate codebases for each platform.

The mobile team can be half the size and still publish ios and Android apps.   

### Feature parity 

You might have seen this a lot. "_available in the latest iPhone app now and Android later this year"_ Or Vise versa. Even large organisations struggle to keep feature parity between their apps. Since Flutter has a single codebase both ios and Android will have the same set of features always. 

### Better Performance

Flutter is not the only cross-platform framework available. But Flutter is the best-performing cross-platform framework available. Flutter controls the whole stack. ie flutter is directly drawing pixels to the canvas. The is no web framework or compiling to native components happening. 

### When not to choose Flutter

it's often better to start with Flutter. Flutter can satisfy most of your product needs. But there are a few cases where it makes sense to go native. 

If your app revolves around a sensor on the phone. Like a camera-centric app. It makes more sense to make the app in Flutter as native gives you more access to the hardware. 

If your app is dependent on a package that is not available on Flutter. 

Overall, Flutter is a great choice for businesses that want to develop apps that can be used by users on both iOS and Android. Most businesses don't require native apps. Start with Flutter and move to native if and when your business demands it.
