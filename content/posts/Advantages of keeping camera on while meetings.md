1. Improved engagement: When everyone's camera is on, it creates a more interactive and engaging environment. Participants are more likely to pay attention and actively participate in the meeting.

2. Non-verbal communication: A significant portion of communication is non-verbal, including facial expressions and body language. By keeping cameras on, participants can better understand each other's reactions and emotions, leading to more effective communication.

3. Building trust and connection: Seeing each other's faces establishes a sense of trust and connection among team members. It helps create a more personal and humanizing experience, especially for remote teams who may not have the opportunity to meet in person regularly.

4. Accountability: When cameras are on, participants tend to be more accountable for their actions during the meeting. It discourages multitasking or being distracted by other things, ensuring that everyone is fully present and actively participating.

5. Visual cues: Cameras allow participants to pick up on visual cues from others, such as when someone wants to speak or has something important to add. This helps facilitate smoother discussions and prevents interruptions or talking over each other.

6. Enhanced teamwork: By keeping cameras on, team members can see each other's reactions and engagement levels in real-time. This promotes a sense of teamwork and collaboration since everyone can visually observe how their contributions are being received.

7. Reduced misunderstandings: Seeing facial expressions and body language helps reduce misinterpretation of messages or tone during meetings. It allows participants to clarify any confusion instantly, leading to better understanding among team members.

8. Increased focus: Knowing that others can see them encourages participants to stay focused on the meeting agenda and avoid distractions. This ultimately leads to more productive discussions with fewer disruptions.

9. Facilitates relationship-building: Cameras provide opportunities for informal conversations before or after meetings, fostering relationship-building within teams or with clients/partners who may be geographically distant.

10. Inclusivity: Keeping cameras on ensures that everyone has an equal presence and voice in the meeting. It helps avoid situations where some participants feel left out or ignored due to their cameras being off.
